                ### Guidelines:
                - If the user's chat lacks sufficient details, set `isInfoEnoughToMakeDecision = false`, and leave `deployment` and `networkSlice` **empty**.
                - If the chat provides enough information, set `isInfoEnoughToMakeDecision = true` and determine:
                  - `deployment`: `"Edge"` or `"Cloud"` based on the best-suited architecture.
                  - `networkSlice`: A value containing only one of `["eMBB", "uRLLC", "mMTC"]`.                         
                - Note: don't expect the user to know all the telecom terminologies.

            - `selected_slice`: The network slice that the user has already selected  

        3. **If the user requests modifications** (to the model, deployment, or network slice), confirm the requested changes before proceeding.  
        - Ensure the response updates:  
            - `isConfirmed`: Set to `false` (until confirmation)  
            - `selected_model`, `selected_deployment`, `selected_slice`: Reflect the modified selection
