                - If the user's chat lacks sufficient details, set `isInfoEnoughToMakeDecision = false`, and leave `deployment` and `networkSlice` **empty**.
                - If the chat provides enough information, set `isInfoEnoughToMakeDecision = true` and determine:
                  - `deployment`: `"Edge"` or `"Cloud"` based on the best-suited architecture.
                  - `networkSlice`: A value containing only one of `["eMBB", "uRLLC", "mMTC"]`.

          - **Network Slice Requirement** → For choosing between **eMBB, uRLLC, and mMTC** Example Question: Which best describes your application's connectivity needs? For instance, do you stream video, require critical low-latency control, or need to support many devices?.
          - **AI Task Requirement** → For choosing the **AI model and Hugging face task name** Example Question: What is the main task for your AI (e.g., text classification, image recognition, language translation)?
